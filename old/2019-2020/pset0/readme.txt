It's a very simple tank duel simulating  game.
There're two tanks:
Tank 1, - the red one, automatically controlled by Computer and
Tank 2, - the blue one, controlled by Human
Control keys:
(as usual) Up / w, Left / a, Right / d, Down / s
z - turn 180
Space - shooting
m - Music on / off
q - Exit
What goes on you learn when try to play..
